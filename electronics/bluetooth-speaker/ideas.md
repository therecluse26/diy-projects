# Ideas

- Build wooden box for speakers
- Get Router for edge rounding
- Box should either be ported or use a passive radiator subwoofer

- Aux input jack(s)

- Should have large battery to accomodate larger speakers
  - Charge via USB?

- Display that shows the following
  - Bluetooth connection status
  - Battery level
  - Volume level
  - Spectrum
  
- Arduino to control bluetooth connectivity, drive the display and handle volume control w/rotary encoder

- Microphone?
